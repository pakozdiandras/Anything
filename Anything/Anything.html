          Snake is a video game that originated during the late 1970s in arcades
          becoming something of a classic. It became the standard pre-loaded
          game on Nokia phones in 1998.

          The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which
          roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other
          item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the
          playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows
          longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the
          direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the
          snake's body follows.
